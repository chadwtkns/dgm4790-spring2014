I want to be able to "zoom" in and out from daily, to weekly to monthly views to see everything headed my way at once, or just the most important items that day/week. 

Input
     User ID
     Dean touches a tab of his choice (Date range filter)
     Today's date sent to database

Output
     View changes to match his choice
     Events are shown for that date range
          Yearly/Quarterly/"Semesterly"
          Monthly events
          Weekly events
          Today's events
     

Event
     No Internet Connection
     No events to pull
     Could not connect to database




Input
     Clicks button to send error log
     Error log is sent to developers



Notes:
     Do we want to have custom date filters? 
     Within each "view" (visual radar/list/event boxes, etc), they can filter by date range
